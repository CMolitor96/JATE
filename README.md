# **JATE**

## Project Description
JATE or Just Another Text Editor is a web based text editor that was created as a progressive web application, so it can be downloaded and used offline. JATE is built with webpack bundler, workbox service worker, and an express back end. Writing code in JATE is stored both online and off in both local storage and indexDB storage, so you never have to worry about losing precious code.
